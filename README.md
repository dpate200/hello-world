Hello World, My name is Deep Patel and I am relatively new to the computer world, but I am more than ever excited to
be working with something as amazing as this. I think coding enables people to do almost anything and that in and of 
itself is better than anything anyone could ask for. Wish me luck on my journey to become prominent and succesful.
